# [NextJS|https://nextjs.org/] & [Nx|https://nx.dev/]
I have chosen to use the NextJS framework instead of the regular ReactJS and Express to avoide the manual setup of:
- TypeScript
- Jest / React Testing Library / Cypress
- Linter
- Prettier
- Babel
- Webpack
- nodemon
- React Router
- .gitignore
- and many other stauf + wiring frontend and backend togther

ReactJS and Express are just libraries that have some best practices, but I believe it's better to use frameworks with already set guides, instructions and best practices baked in, described in docs and awailable as [video]-tutorials, so it's easier to understand and to follow, rather than setting all those guides yourself. In case of using common framework rather that custom setup we can hire skilled devs that previusly worked with this framework and know how to use it, insted of getting used with our custom setup.

NextJS is build by Vercel, so we can deploy our app to Vercel instead of Heroku or Firebase Hosting.
